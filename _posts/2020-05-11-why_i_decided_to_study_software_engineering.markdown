## Law or Code?

When I was in High School, I was obsessed with two things: * John Grisham novels, and visual basic*.  I was just starting to learn to build my own computers and really enjoyed using written word to make things happen on a computer.  When it came time to decide whether I wanted to purse a computer science degree or a legal career I chose the latter.   Now that I am slightly older, have a family and a business, I felt it was time to learn the 'other' obsession.  

## I also have a practical reason for becoming a software engineer:  

As much as I would love to say that 'software engineering' was the 'other passion' and have the story end happily ever after there.... I have another good reason...   Unlike most people, I am not strictly looking to make a career change.  I participate in two companies that create their own productivity software and to be frank I need to know (on a granular level) what the guys building the software are doing.  

For a number of years now we have worked with various technologies that I could discuss on a high level, but couldn't in any technical capacity.   These technologies included (but were not limited to) javascript, node js, react, angular, ruby and rails.   In order to help build my techincal knowledge and guide decision-making, I felt this was a logical, and necessary step. 

## ***Code is the Language of the Future***

Finally, it has become apparent that coding and software engineering is the language of the future and required learning for school age children.  My kids entered lower school and were quickly becoming conversant in javascript as a component of their everyday curriculum.   In order to be the best parent I can be, and to best support them at school, I decided it was important to learn to code so that I can participate in their learning at the same level.   

I look forward to the journey ahead -- and I will share that journey in blog posts.  As this is my first, I feel it is appropriate to end my first blog with one of the first lines of code I wrote (adapted to Ruby):

```
puts "Hello World!"
```
