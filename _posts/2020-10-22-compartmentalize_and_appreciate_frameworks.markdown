Rails was a doozy.  The project itself was a substantial step up in both size and complexity from the Sinatra project.  Getting started was a feat in itself, because of how I chose to conceptualize the entire project.  It very quickly becomes overwhelming when you think of everything you need to do to get to completion when you are thinking of the final product as one piece.   Fortunately, rails makes it a lot easier to actually get started  ```rails new [project_name]```, and to do general tasks in the code ``` resources :user```. 

I learned very quickly that there is significant value in attacking large, complex projects one piece at a time.  I began to look at the entire project as the sum of 100 different pieces of code, and that all I had to focus on was 1 piece at any given time.  If I got too caught up in one area, or started to panic at the size, I turned my focus to a smaller piece that I could complete.  Eventually, the sum of the pieces begain to take shape, and ```Work It Out``` came to life.  

My new mantra: 

1. Conceptualize the goals of the project, but view it as pieces of a whole rather than one project. 
2. Work on small, winnable pieces before attacking the more complex ones. 
3. Largely ignore form until functionality is complete or mostly complete.  
4. Have fun.  There is a real sense of accomplishment in completing each piece, even if you can't see the whole yet.  

Lastly - I have come to appriecate Rails (and other frameworks) for what they are.  Simple things generators for ```migrations```, ```resources``` for routes, and ``` form_with``` make life a whole lot easier.  Its substantially easier to conceptualize an entire project when you don't need to constantly be working on the routine pieces that make an application work.
